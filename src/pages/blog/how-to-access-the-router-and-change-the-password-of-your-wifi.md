# How to access and change the password of your router
 1. Open a web browser and type in the IP address of your router. This can be found by connecting to the wifi, going to the wifi settings in your phone, and checking the 'Router' section. It is usually 192.168.1.1, or 192.168.0.1. If you are unsure, you can try both.


 2. The browser will show a login page. The default username is `admin` and the default password is `admin`.
 3. Once you're in, find the 'SSID' tab and click on it.
 4. Find the 'change password' section, it could also be called 'password' and change the password to something you'll remember.
 5. !note! theres a difference between the password for the router and the password for the wifi. The password for the wifi is the one you just changed, the password for the router is the one you used to login to the router.
 6. Congrats! You've changed the password of your router!
