 2. Check the 'Router' section. The router ip address is usually 192.168.1.1, or 192.168.0.1. If you are unsure, you can try both.

 >note! theres a difference between the password for the router and the password for the wifi. The password for the wifi is the one you just changed, the password for the router is the one you used to login to the router.
